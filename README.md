## Creating a Tableau Dashboard for Four-Year Institutions Using IPEDS Data

This repository is for the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) dataset created for a Tableau Dashboard (link will be provided once completed). This repository includes the [R Scripts](https://github.com/drcdavidson/IPEDS_Data/blob/main/IPEDS_Scripts.R) used to create the [final CSV file](https://github.com/drcdavidson/IPEDS_Data/blob/main/Final_INST.csv) for Tableau and the 15 [CSV files from IPEDS](https://github.com/drcdavidson/IPEDS_Data/tree/main/CSVs) to create the dataset.

### METHODOLOGY

#### Choosing Sample of Institutions

To choose the data from IPEDS, I used the following parameters to choose the institutions: - State or Other Jurisdiction: All 50 States and DC - Sector: *Public,* *4-year or above* and *Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above*

This gave be 2,370 sample institutions.
